# Forecasting-demand-of-bikeshare-trips

Background:
A bicycle-sharing system, public bicycle system, or bike-share scheme is a service in which bicycles are made
available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Most bike share systems allow people
to borrow a bike from a "dock" and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Bikesharing systems
have been increasingly popular in recent years, all around the world. In the United States alone, there are at least 119
bike-sharing systems that, in total, share about 4,800 docking stations as of January 2017.

The Issue with Bike-sharing:
With the surge in bike share usage, comes the challenge of forecasting the trips that will be made from different
stations so that bikes can be effectively distributed for commuters to avail the facility. Since bike-sharing platforms
suffer from cyclic travel patterns, there is a tendency for bikes to get collected at certain busy stations at rush-hours.
Currently, bikes are manually redistributed between stations to ensure availability of both bikes and docks.
Unavailability of bikes can deter ridership and stagnant demand. From the service providerâ€™s point of view:
proactively redistributing bikes between stations to ensure availability of both bikes and docks to return bikes, can
help to solve this problem. If we can accurately forecast how many trips can we expect at any station at any hour of
the day, it would help to redistribute bikes in advance to meet the demand.

Objective:
Through this project, we aim to forecast with reasonable accuracy, the number of trips that will be made from a
station at a given date and hour. With the forecast, we can then evaluate whether the station can meet the forecasted
demand or will it require rebalancing. Business can also evaluate its strategy to install or remove docking stands at a
particular station based on the the predicted future demand.
